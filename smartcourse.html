                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>The former sales page had a high bounce rate and usability issues. We used HotJar and Google Analytics to see how users were interacting with Smart Course pages.</p>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>As a startup, the client had a slim budget for design. This was a constraint I could not control, so I made the most of the time allotted.
                    
                    There wasn’t a lot of user flows to work with to get started. The founder wanted me to redesign pages that were already built, so I made sure to understand what users want to achieve when going through the site. </p>

                    <p>I learned so much working with a startup company. I enjoyed being part of a vision that is dedicated to making healthcare and education more accessible to students with ADHD.
                        I did feel as though I took on more than just UI/UX, and therefore I wasn’t able to push myself quite as far as I wanted in the field, but I learned many new skills that I wouldn’t have otherwise experienced. Due to time constraints I was not able to dive into my sign process the way I would like to approach it but it made me realize what is most important in the process: test, test, test! I learned so much from the users I was able to speak to, and I look forward to seeing how Smart Course grows.
